# Lattirust - A Rust Library for Lattice-based Cryptography

Lattirust is a Rust library for safe and efficient lattice-based cryptography, in particular for zero-knowledge proofs.
Lattirust aims to be like [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) for lattice-based constructions, and like [lattigo](https://github.com/tune-insight/lattigo) for zero-knowledge and succinct proofs. 

This repository is primarily maintained by [Christian Knabenhans](https://cknabs.github.io); see [CONTRIBUTORS.md](/CONTRIBUTORS.md) for a list of contributors. 
If you encounter any correctness, security, or performance issues, please [open an issue](/issues/new/choose); pull requests are also always welcome!

## Why Lattices?
Lattices allow for a wide range of quantum-secure cryptography. Due to the additional structure present in lattice assumptions compared to other post-quantum assumptions (e.g., collision-resistant hash functions), lattice-based cryptographic protocols are often more efficient. 

## Why Rust?
- Safety: Rust enforces memory safety, but also allows us to enforce more fine-grained security properties through Rustâ€™s strong and expressive type system. 
- Performance: Rust allows for close-to-the-metal performance; in particular it is not garbage-collected (in constrast to other languages like Go), which allows for reliable, predictable, and reproducible benchmarks, which is important for academic and more exploratory contexts. 
- ZK ecosystem: the succinct and zero-knowledge proofs community (from both academia and industry) has written many artifacts and tools in Rust; we aim to interface with many of those tools, e.g., by being compatible with various frontends, or by using higher-order safety crates like [nimue](https://github.com/arkworks/nimue) for secure Fiat-Shamir transformations.
- Formal verification: Rust is also the language of choice for modern formal verification; medium-term, we hope to formally verify (parts of) lattirust, e.g. by using [hax](https://github.com/hacspec/hax). 

## Structure
This repository contains the following Rust crates: 

### Core
- [lattirust_arithmetic](lattirust_arithmetic/): 
Implementations of power-of-two cyclotomic rings $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(X^{2^k}+1)$, number-theoretic transforms, matrices and vectors, various norms and challenge sets. 
Also contains wrappers and helper traits around the excellent [nimue](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/nimue) library (which enforces secure instantiations of the Fiat-Shamir transformation), making it easier to work with in lattice protocols.

- [lattice-estimator](lattice-estimator/):
Wrappers around the [lattice-estimator](https://github.com/malb/lattice-estimator) (for SIS) and [pq-crystals/security-estimates](https://github.com/pq-crystals/security-estimates) for MSIS).

### Protocols
- [labrador](labrador/):
An implementation of the [LaBRADOR protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1341) (concretely small proof sizes, linear verifier). 
- [lova](lova/):
An implementation of the Lova lattice folding scheme.

## Security
Lattirust is provided for research and prototyping purposes, and has not been audited nor is fit for real-world deployment. Always consult your trusted cryptographer before using lattirust in security-critical protocols.
